# C++ Constructor Homework - Budget
Homework for Intro to C++ demonstrating use of constructors in a simple budget program.

## Requirements

Create a class based on the monthly budget structure from last week but only include member items: rent, water and garbage.
 Include an accessor and a mutator (getter and setter) for each item, setup a default constructor (with some default values) and include a total function that is not stored as a member item but just is calculated when requested.
 
 Once you are done, create three objects as part of your program that demonstrate your class including one that uses the default constructor.


# Also included, 

in the Budget folder, is another assignment that splits the Budget project into .cpp and .h files.

## Requirements

For the budget class from last week, separate out the class from the main program into two separate files - (main file and .h file).
    One can also do three files including an implementation file but that does not work with Dev-C.
